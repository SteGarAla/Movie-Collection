# Movie Collection
Second Group project By : Steven Garcia-Alamilla & Curt Lynch

## Project Description
Your client's movie collection has gotten a bit out of control. At any given time he has no idea what movies he happens to have in his collection. In this assignment you will get additional practice using the STD library by maintaining a linked list database of movie entries. In order to leverage the efficient insertion that linked lists offer (O(1) (constant time) insertion in the front, middle, or back of the list), your program will maintain the linked list in sorted order.
